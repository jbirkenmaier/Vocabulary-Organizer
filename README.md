In this project I aim to build a tool to learn vocabulary. It will allow the user to learn an ammount of words, set by the user. The goal is to learn words first, depending on their importance. For this I will use statistics provided by the open source dictionary "Wiktionary".

This project is currently still in the early stages

The function "web_dictionary" was implemented. This function will translate to english, given words in a language specified by the user. Currently Turkish to English works okay, other languages remain to be tested. 
The goal is, to enable the user to go through long lists of words and get them translated. This will be useful for the goal of this project, namely the creation of a vocabulary list containing the 1000 most important vocabularies.
